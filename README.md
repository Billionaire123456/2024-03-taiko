## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-taiko/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).



_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

# Overview

Taiko is a Based rollup. You can learn about Based rollup by following links below:

- https://ethresear.ch/t/based-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-sequencing/15016
- https://taiko.mirror.xyz/7dfMydX1FqEx9_sOvhRt3V8hJksKSIWjzhCVu7FyMZU

This version of the Taiko protocol is also known as Based Contestable Rollup, or BCR. You can learn about BCR design using these links:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6ncZirXPfc


There are also a few documents in [packages/protocol/docs](packages/protocol/docs) that you can take a look. We are working on making them into our official documentation before mainnet launch. Sorry that these files are not well maintained but I think they may give you some extra insights into BCR's design and/or implementation.

A built-in cross-layer communication machinmims is also included in the core protocol code to faciliate cross-multiple layer communcation. We call it multi-hop bridging. You can learn about the basic design in [`this file`](packages/protocol/docs/multihop_bridging_deployment.md).


## Links

- **Previous audits:** 

An [older version](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/releases/tag/protocol-v0.16.0%2Bbcr.locked) of the protocol has been audited Sigma Prime ([report](packages/protocol/audit/sigma_prime_taiko_smart_contract_security_assessment_report_v2_0.pdf)). The corresponding bridge code has been audited by QuillAudits ([report](packages/protocol/audit/quill_audits_taiko_smart_contract_audit_report.pdf)).

Please see [a list of changes](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/releases/tag/protocol-v1.0.0) between the audited version and the current v1.0.0 release.

# Additional Context

- Our vaults shall work with all ERC20, ERC1155, and ERC721 tokens, respectively.
- The AssignmentHook contract shall support any ERC20 tokens and Ether as proving fees.
- The core protocol only supports TaikoToken as bonds.
- Contracts in `packages/contracts/team` are expect with work the TaikoToken.sol and a future (ERC-721) Taiko NFT only .
- TaikoL1, TaikoGovernor, TaikoTimelockController, and TaikoToken will be deployed on Ethereum; TaikoL2 will be deployed on Taiko L2. All other contracts including AddressManager, SignalService, Bridge, Vaults, and Bridged tokens will be deployed on both Ethereum and Taiko L2.
- All contracts have an owner who can upgrade contract code and perform certain special actions. There are also special named roles such as "proposer", "proposer_one", "bridge_pauser" that can call special functions, these named roles can be configured to be address(0) to disable these functions. Please search for `onlyFromNamed` to locate these special roles.
- `BridgedERC20` has a special role called snapshooter, once set, this role can take snapshots.


## Attack ideas

- DoS attacking the core protocol.
- Exploit bugs in Merkle proof verification logics.
- Exploit potential bugs in multi-hop bridging, for example, a multi-hop may contains a loop.
- Construct bridge messages whose hash collide.
- Keep contesting valid proofs to delay block confirmation.
- Exhaust the L1 block proposing ring-buffer to hault the chain.
- Explore bugs in L2's anchor transaction.


## Scoping Details 


- If you have a public code repo, please share it here: https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/tree/main/packages/protocol 
- How many contracts are in scope?: 81
- Total SLoC for these contracts?: 7611
- How many external imports are there?: 52
- How many separate interfaces and struct definitions are there for the contracts within scope?: 85
- Does most of your code generally use composition or inheritance?: Composition   
- How many external calls?: 0   
- What is the overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests?: 79
- Is this an upgrade of an existing system?: False
- Check all that apply (e.g. timelock, NFT, AMM, ERC20, rollups, etc.): ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, Rollup, SGX, Multi-Chain, Bridging
- Is there a need to understand a separate part of the codebase / get context in order to audit this part of the protocol?: False   
- Please describe required context: you must understand how rollup works.
- Does it use an oracle?:  No
- Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models your code uses: None 
- Is this either a fork of or an alternate implementation of another project?: False  
- Does it use a side-chain?: No
